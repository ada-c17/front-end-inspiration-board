## Skills Assessed
* Following directions and reading comprehension
* Using git as part of the development workflow
* Demonstrating interaction between front-end layer and back-end layer
* Applying deployment practices
* Practice independent research

Working with the Flask framework:

* Creating models
* Creating conventional RESTful CRUD routes for a model
* Create unconventional routes for custom behavior
* Apply knowledge about environment variables
* Creating a one-to-many relationship between two models

Working with the React JS library:

* Sending data to nested components through props
* Receiving and using props within a component
* Initializing and using state within a component
* Passing callback functions to child components and use them to update state

## Goal
Once upon a time, there existed an Ada Developers Academy office with an inspiration board...

It was a delightful board, where people could anonymously post short messages of encouragement to each other. It was filled with the kindest words and the nerdiest programming jokes.

![board](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60857422/204662440-852c9fa2-f0a5-4382-8d1e-2b22b1075afc.jpeg)

_Fig. A corkboard full of pinned sticky notes, where each sticky note has a short, inspirational message._

Our goal is to create a digital inspiration board.

Users should be able to create one or more boards.

Then, a user can select a single board. When a user selects a board, they can see all the cards associated with that board.

Users can even "+1" the cards that they agree with!

We will use this project as a chance to see how the front-end layer and back-end layer interact. This is also an opportunity to bring some creativity to the UI.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
