        Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the
        western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an
        utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape- descended life
        forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches
        are a pretty neat idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the
        people living on it were mean to the otter species.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyday they were met with rude remarks and ridicule that was just too
        much to bear. Until one day, all of the otters finally teamed up and
        built a rockets that launched them into space!
      </p>
      <p>
        Once in space, they built an otter colony and vowed to always be kind to
        each other and inspire one another to be the best version of themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        They came up with a great idea to create a communial inspiration board
        where they were able to stick to their word by writing encouraging and
        kind notes to one another in OtterSpace.
